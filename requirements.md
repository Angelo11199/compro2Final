Background:

Understanding and manipulating data structures are key skills in computer science.
This exercise is designed to strengthen your knowledge and practical skills in working with arrays in C++.

Objective:

Your task is to create a C++ program from scratch that performs a series of operations on an array,
as specified in a menu. You are required to design and implement functions corresponding to each operation to
achieve the desired output.
Apply all modules/topics discussed in our subject/class. Starting with Array up to Object Oriented
Programming.

Program Requirements:

Your program should initially populate an array with predetermined values. The user will then interact
with the program through a menu that offers the following operations:

Display Array Contents
Insert Element
Delete Element
Swap Elements
Reverse Array
Find Element
Print File
Exit Program

Tasks:

Initialize the Array:

    *Start with an array of integers with a fixed size (e.g., 20 elements) and prepopulate it with some values.

Create Functions:

    *Display: A function to display the current contents of the array.
    *Insert: A function to insert a new element at a specified position.
    *Delete: A function to delete an element from a specified position.
    *Swap: A function to swap two elements at specified positions.
    *Reverse: A function to reverse the order of the array elements.
    *Find Element: A function to search for a specific value in the array and return its position.
    If the element is not found, return -1.
    *Print: A function that creates a file that are ready to be printed.
    These functions should be able to handle cases and invalid inputs gracefully.

Implement the Menu:

    *Create a user-friendly menu using a loop, allowing the user to choose an operation to perform on the array.
    *The program should continue displaying the menu after completing an operation until the user chooses to exit.

Validation and Testing:

    *Implement input validation to ensure the user inputs are within the appropriate range and format.

    *Test each function extensively to ensure reliability and correctness.

Introduction

    *Purpose of the Document: Briefly describe the purpose of this document and the associated programming task.
    *Program Overview: Provide an overview of what the program does, focusing on its array manipulation
    functionalities.

Program Description

    *Objective: State the primary goal of the program.
    *Functionalities:
    *List each functionality provide a brief description.

Implementation Details

    *Environment & Tools: List the development environment and tools used (e.g., C++ version, IDE).

    *Structure:
        Main Function: Describe how the main function operates and handles user inputs.
        Array Initialization: Explain how the array is initialized and populated.
        Function Descriptions: For each function describe:
            Purpose
            Input Parameters
            Process/Logic
            Output/Return Value

Testing & Results

    *Testing Methodology: Describe how you tested each functionality.
    *Test Cases:
        Provide several test cases for each function.
        Include inputs, expected outputs, and actual outputs.
        Example:
            Test Case 1: Initial Display
                Input: Display command on program start.
                Expected Output: The initial array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 0, ...].
                Actual Output: Matches expected output.
                Observations: Function correctly displays the initial state of the array.
