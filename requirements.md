FINAL PROJECT CCS0007/L - OPERATIONS PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT
Background:
Understanding and manipulating data structures are key skills in computer
science.
This exercise is designed to strengthen your knowledge and practical
skills in working with arrays in C++.
Objective:
Your task is to create a C++ program from scratch that performs a series
of operations on an array,
as specified in a menu. You are required to design and implement functions
corresponding to each operation to
achieve the desired output.
Apply all modules/topics discussed in our subject/class. Starting with
Array up to Object Oriented
Programming.
Program Requirements:
Your program should initially populate an array with predetermined values.
The user will then interact
with the program through a menu that offers the following operations:
Display Array Contents
Insert Element
Delete Element
Swap Elements
Reverse Array
Find Element
Print File
Exit Program


Tasks:
Initialize the Array:
* Start with an array of integers with a fixed size (e.g., 20
elements) and prepopulate it with some values.

Create Functions:
* Display: A function to display the current contents of the array.
* Insert: A function to insert a new element at a specified position.
* Delete: A function to delete an element from a specified position.
* Swap: A function to swap two elements at specified positions.
* Reverse: A function to reverse the order of the array elements.
* Find Element: A function to search for a specific value in the array and return its position.
If the element is not found, return -1.
*Print: A function that creates a file that are ready to be printed.

These functions should be able to handle cases and invalid inputs
gracefully.

Implement the Menu:
* Create a user-friendly menu using a loop, allowing the user to
choose an operation to perform on the array.
* The program should continue displaying the menu after completing an
operation until the user chooses to exit.
Validation and Testing:
* Implement input validation to ensure the user inputs are within the
appropriate range and format.
* Test each function extensively to ensure reliability and
correctness.
